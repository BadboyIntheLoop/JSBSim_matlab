<!--
    This Compositor pipeline imitates the classic forward pipeline used before
    multi-pass rendering was introduced. It doesn't involve any FBOs and all the
    rendering happens in two passes rendering directly to the screen.

    The precision of the Z-buffer deteriorates with huge near-far spreads, so
    two passes with different depth ranges are used to avoid Z-fighting and
    other unpleasantness.
