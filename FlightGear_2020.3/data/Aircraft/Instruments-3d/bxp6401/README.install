To install this instrument into your aircraft, you need to do the following:

1.	Enable the <transponder> module through the aircraft's instrumentation.xml (in case a custom one is used)
2.	Add bxp6401.nas to your aircraft's list of included nasal files:
	<nasal>
		...
		<bxp6401>
			<file>Aircraft/Instruments-3d/bxp6401/bxp6401.nas</file>
		</bxp6401>
		...
	</nasal>
	** Note that it is important to put the file into <bxp6401></bxp6401> tags, as the animation xml references the instrument by that name
3.	Add the model to your aircraft:
	<model>
		<path>Aircraft/Instruments-3d/bxp6401/bxp6401.xml</path>
		...
	</model>
4.	If you are using a custom electric system, make sure the transponder is supplied at /systems/electrical/outputs/transponder[0] when appropriate


## Please report any bugs, issues and improvements either to the mailing list of FlightGear forum so they can be fixed/included in the shared version of this instrument
